# GuMap — 固Map
固 _is strong, solid, and sure—an allusion to this class’s immutability-features._

* GuMap extends JavaScript Map to support dot accessor notation and immutability features.
* This class does not bridge `Map[@@iterator]`: please use entries() instead.
* The class name is a bilingual compound word, transliterating 固Map (_gù-map_) into Latin letters.
